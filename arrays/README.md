#Slices

A very short example of slices in [Go](https://golang.org/). Copied from my examples of [common data structures](https://github.com/obihann/GoDataStructures/stack), I am using the stack as a way to implament slices.

* [**Arrays**](/arrays)
    A stack built with a traditional array. You will notice this as a fixed size.

##Stacks
    A fixed size structure with push and pop methods, following the FILO rule (first in, last out)
